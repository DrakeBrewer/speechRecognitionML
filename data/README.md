Recording instructions:

The morning air was cool and quiet after a night of steady rain. Puddles shimmered on the street, reflecting the soft light of a cloudy sky. A faint breeze carried the smell of wet grass and clean earth. It felt like the world was slowly waking up.

Deep in the forest, sunlight filtered through the tall trees and painted moving patterns on the ground. The sound of birds and rustling leaves filled the air. Each step on the soft soil felt calm and familiar, like the earth itself was breathing.

The kettle began to whistle just as the clock struck eight. Coffee filled the room with a warm, rich smell. Outside, cars passed by and a dog barked in the distance. It was an ordinary morning, but somehow it felt peaceful.

Streetlights flickered on as the last bit of sunlight faded from the sky. People hurried along the sidewalks, their footsteps echoing against the buildings. The city was alive with movement and sound, glowing with energy even after dark.

- Each person should record all four paragraphs in one take (with short pauses between each). That’ll give us about 1 minute long audio file per person. 
- Record in a quiet room with minimal background noise.
- Use your phone or laptop mic — `.wav` or `.m4a` format is fine.
- Keep volume consistent; speak naturally.
- If you can find at least 1 other person, besides yourself, to record that would be helpful. The more recordings we get the better 😎.
- Label the file `name.wav/m4a`
